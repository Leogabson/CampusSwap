# 🎓 CampusSwap

**CampusSwap** is a smart campus marketplace built for Nigerian students. It goes beyond regular buy/sell platforms by enabling bartering, group buying, campus-specific escrow, and student-powered credit systems — all within a safe, university-focused ecosystem.

## 🚀 Features

- **Barter Mode**: Swap items (e.g. textbooks for electronics) without using cash.
- **Group Buys**: Students can team up to buy items in bulk and split costs.
- **Campus Escrow**: Secure payment system that holds funds until physical handover is confirmed.
- **Campus Credit**: A gamified reward system — earn credit by helping others (e.g. verifying users or making deliveries).
- **Exam Rush Mode**: Prioritized listings for past questions, tutors, and last-minute study materials.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (no frameworks)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first media queries
- **Optional Backend (later)**: Node.js / Express or Flask
- **Future Integration**: Firebase, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL

## 🔒 Security Goals

- QR code verification for item exchange
- Escrow-based handover system
- Campus-only access via university emails (planned)

## 💡 Why CampusSwap?

Existing platforms like Jiji, WhatsApp, and Facebook are too generic. Nigerian students face:

- Rampant scams
- Poor liquidity (lack of cash)
- No campus-specific rules
- Wasted time negotiating

**CampusSwap solves this with trust, automation, and community-first design.**
